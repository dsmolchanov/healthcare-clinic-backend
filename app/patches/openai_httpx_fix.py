"""
Runtime patch for OpenAI's AsyncHttpxClientWrapper.

Recent versions of httpx (>=0.28) expect the AsyncClient instance to have a
``_state`` attribute when closing. The OpenAI client schedules an asynchronous
``aclose`` inside ``__del__``; during interpreter shutdown or GC this happens
after httpx has already cleared the attribute, leading to noisy
``AttributeError: '_state'`` traces.

We override ``__del__`` to only attempt the async close when the attribute is
present, silently skipping otherwise. This preserves the clean shutdown path
while avoiding the unhandled exception spam in the logs.
