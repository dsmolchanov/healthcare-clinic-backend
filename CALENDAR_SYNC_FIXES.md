# Calendar Sync Fixes - October 7, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Timezone Conversion (Cancun ↔ Google Calendar)
**Problem**: Appointments created in Cancun timezone were sent to Google as UTC, causing time display issues.

**Solution**: Set timezone to `America/Cancun` in all calendar events
- Modified `external_calendar_service.py` lines 874-937
- Now uses `python-dateutil` timezone support
- Times are now correctly displayed in Cancun time in Google Calendar

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before
'timeZone': 'UTC'

# After
'timeZone': 'America/Cancun'
```

### 2. ✅ Rich Event Details (Doctor & Patient Info)
**Problem**: Google Calendar events only showed appointment type (e.g., "Root Canal")

**Solution**: Enhanced event summary and description with full details
- **Summary**: "Root Canal - John Doe with Dr. Smith"
- **Description**: Includes patient name, phone, doctor name, notes, reason

**Example Event**:
```
Title: Root Canal - John Doe with Dr. Smith
Description:
  Patient: John Doe (555-1234)
  Doctor: Dr. Smith
  Notes: Follow-up needed
  Reason: Tooth pain
```

### 3. ✅ Instant Outbound Sync
**Problem**: New appointments took up to 15 minutes to appear in Google Calendar (polling interval)

**Solution**: Added instant sync triggers to appointment create/update endpoints
- Modified `appointments_api.py` to trigger sync immediately after booking
- Uses FastAPI background tasks for non-blocking execution
- Sync happens within seconds instead of 15 minutes

**Endpoints Enhanced**:
- `POST /api/appointments/book` → Instant sync after booking
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/reschedule` → Instant sync after reschedule

### 4. ✅ Webhook Channel Handling
**Problem**: Old/expired webhook channels caused 500 errors

**Solution**: Already handled gracefully in existing code
- Unknown channels return `{"status": "ignored"}` instead of 500
- Logs warning but continues processing
- Only active channel (`0ac3abdf`) processes successfully

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified
1. **app/services/external_calendar_service.py**
   - Lines 874-949: Timezone and event details enhancement

2. **app/api/appointments_api.py**
   - Lines 20-35: Added `sync_appointment_to_google()` background task
   - Lines 214-218: Instant sync after booking
   - Lines 260-264: Instant sync after rescheduling

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Timezone Display
1. Create appointment at 2:00 PM Cancun time
2. Check Google Calendar
3. ✅ Should show 2:00 PM (not 8:00 PM UTC)

### Test 2: Event Details
1. Create appointment with patient "John Doe", doctor "Dr. Smith", type "Root Canal"
2. Open event in Google Calendar
3. ✅ Title should be "Root Canal - John Doe with Dr. Smith"
4. ✅ Description should include patient phone and doctor name

### Test 3: Instant Sync
1. Create appointment via API
2. Check Google Calendar within 5 seconds
3. ✅ Event should appear immediately (not after 15 minutes)

### Test 4: Inbound Sync (Already Working)
1. Edit appointment time in Google Calendar
2. Check internal database within 5 seconds
3. ✅ Changes should be reflected

## Deployment

Run these commands to deploy:

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Calendar sync improvements - timezone, details, instant sync"
git push origin main

# Deploy to Fly.io
fly deploy -a healthcare-clinic-backend
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Multi-Doctor Sub-Calendars (Your Suggestion)
This is an excellent idea! Here's how to implement it:

**Concept**: Create one Google Calendar per doctor with different colors
- Dr. Smith → Blue calendar
- Dr. Jones → Green calendar
- Dr. Garcia → Red calendar

**Benefits**:
- Better visual organization
- Can toggle doctors on/off in Google Calendar UI
- Each doctor can have their own calendar share permissions

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Create secondary calendars via Google Calendar API for each doctor
2. Store calendar ID per doctor in `doctors` table
3. Modify sync to use doctor-specific calendar instead of "primary"
4. Set different `colorId` per doctor

Would you like me to implement this feature?

## Current Status

- ✅ Timezone fixed (Cancun time preserved)
- ✅ Event details enriched (doctor + patient info)
- ✅ Instant sync enabled (no more 15-minute wait)
- ✅ Inbound sync working (Google → Database in real-time)
- ⏳ Ready to deploy

**Next**: Deploy and test!
