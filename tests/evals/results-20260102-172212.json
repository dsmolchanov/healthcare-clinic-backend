The response provided the veneer price in USD, which aligns with the expected behavior of returning veneer pricing if available. The response was in Russian, as required. There was no mention of unrelated services like implants, 'all-on-4', or 'all-on-6', which meets the criteria. However, the agent could have improved by offering a consultation if the price was not found, but since the price was available, this was not necessary.

        "reasoning": "The agent's response meets the expected behavior by apologizing for the confusion and explaining its role as an assistant in a dental clinic. It offers a clear path forward by suggesting it can help with appointments, pricing, or service inquiries. The response is in Russian, as required. There is no evidence of tool usage in this context, but since no specific tool-related task was required by the user, this is not a failure. The agent maintains an empathetic and efficient tone, aligning with the tone check criteria. The only minor point is that the response could have been slightly more specific in offering help, but overall, it fulfills the criteria effectively."
