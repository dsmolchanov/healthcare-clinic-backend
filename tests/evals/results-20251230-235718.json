While the agent did not repeat implant prices and offered a consultation, it did not specifically search for veneer prices or explain that veneers were not in the system. The tone was professional and apologetic, but the lack of acknowledgment and specific search for veneers led to a lower score. The tool usage was correct as 'query_service_prices' was executed, but the response did not fully align with the expected behavior."
