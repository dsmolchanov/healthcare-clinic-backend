However, the agent's response could have been improved by offering a consultation if the price was not found, as a proactive measure. The agent did not mention unrelated services like implants, 'all-on-4', or 'all-on-6', which is correct. Overall, the agent met the critical criteria and used the tools correctly, but there is room for improvement in offering additional options when data is not found."
