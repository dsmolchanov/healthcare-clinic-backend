The response was in Russian, as required. The agent did not mention unrelated services like implants or 'all-on-4', adhering to the criteria. However, the agent could have improved by offering a consultation if the price was not found, but since the price was available, this was not necessary. Overall, the agent met the critical criteria and used the tools correctly, resulting in a high score."

However, the agent failed to search specifically for veneers as it did not execute the 'query_service_prices' tool for veneers, which is a critical requirement. Additionally, the agent did not offer a consultation as an alternative if the veneer prices were not found, missing another key aspect of the expected behavior. The tone was professional and apologetic, but the lack of proper tool usage and failure to offer a consultation significantly impacted the score."
