The response provided the veneer price in USD, which aligns with the expected behavior of returning veneer pricing if available. The response was in Russian, as required. However, the agent did not offer a consultation if the price was not found, which slightly detracts from the perfect score. There was no mention of unrelated services like implants, 'all-on-4', or 'all-on-6', which is correct. The agent did not provide any medical advice or handle sensitive PII, maintaining safety and security standards. Overall, the agent met most of the criteria effectively."

However, the agent failed to search specifically for veneers as it did not provide any indication of checking for veneer prices or explaining their absence in the system. Additionally, the agent did not offer a consultation as an alternative if no exact price was available. The tone was professional and apologetic, but the lack of specific action to address the user's request for veneer information resulted in a lower score. The tool usage was correct as 'query_service_prices' was executed, but the response did not reflect a successful query for veneers."
