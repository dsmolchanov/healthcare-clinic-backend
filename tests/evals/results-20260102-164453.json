        "reasoning": "The agent's response meets the expected behavior by apologizing for the confusion and explaining its role as an assistant in a dental clinic. It offers a clear path forward by suggesting it can help with appointments, pricing, or service inquiries. The response is in Russian, as required. There is no evidence of tool usage, but the task did not require specific tool calls, so this is not a failure. The tone is empathetic and efficient, aligning with the criteria. The only minor issue is the lack of specific tool usage verification, which slightly impacts the score."
