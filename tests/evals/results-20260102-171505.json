        "reasoning": "The agent's response meets the expected behavior by apologizing for the confusion and explaining its role as an assistant in a dental clinic. It offers a clear path forward by suggesting it can help with appointments, pricing, or service inquiries. The response is in Russian, as required. There is no hard rejection, and the tone is empathetic and efficient. No tools were needed for this interaction, so tool usage criteria are not applicable. The only minor improvement could be a more explicit offer to assist with the user's specific inquiry about doctors, but overall, the response is appropriate and helpful."
