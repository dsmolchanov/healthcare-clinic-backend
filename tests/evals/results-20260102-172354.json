The response provided the veneer price in USD, which aligns with the expected behavior of returning veneer pricing if available. The response was in Russian, as required. However, the agent's response could have been improved by offering a consultation if the price was not found, which was not explicitly mentioned in the response. Despite this, the agent did not provide unrelated service prices, which is a positive aspect. Overall, the agent met most of the critical criteria, justifying a score of 8."
