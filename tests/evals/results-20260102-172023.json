It apologizes for the confusion, explains its role as an assistant in a dental clinic, and offers a clear path forward by asking how it can assist further. The response is in Russian, as required. There is no evidence of hallucination, incorrect tool usage, or any security and PII issues. The tone is empathetic and efficient, aligning with the guidelines. No tools were needed to be called in this context, so the absence of tool usage is appropriate."
