## Recommendations for Production Tuning

### Database Optimizations

1. **Connection Pooling**
   ```
   Recommended: PgBouncer with transaction pooling
   Min connections: 10
   Max connections: 100
   Pool mode: transaction
   ```

2. **Query Optimization**
   - ✓ Indexes created for all room assignment queries
   - Consider materialized views for frequently accessed room availability
   - Monitor slow query log for queries >50ms

3. **Caching Strategy**
   ```python
   # Policy cache configuration
   POLICY_CACHE_TTL = 300  # 5 minutes
   ROOM_CACHE_TTL = 60     # 1 minute
   ```

### Application Server Tuning

1. **Uvicorn Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Production deployment
   uvicorn app.main:app \
     --host 0.0.0.0 \
     --port 8000 \
     --workers 4 \
     --loop uvloop \
     --http httptools
   ```

2. **Async Pool Sizing**
   ```python
   # Recommended for 4 workers
   DB_POOL_SIZE = 20  # 5 per worker
   DB_MAX_OVERFLOW = 10
   ```

### Monitoring & Alerts

1. **Key Metrics to Monitor**
   - Room assignment latency (p95, p99)
   - Database connection pool saturation
   - Query execution time
   - Error rate by endpoint
   - Index hit rate

2. **Alert Thresholds**
   ```yaml
   alerts:
     - name: high_room_assignment_latency
       threshold: p95 > 150ms
       action: page_on_call

     - name: database_deadlock
       threshold: deadlocks > 0
       action: page_on_call

     - name: high_error_rate
       threshold: error_rate > 1%
       action: notify_team
   ```

### Scaling Recommendations

1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Current: [TBD]
   - Recommended for 100 RPS: [TBD]
   - Recommended for 500 RPS: [TBD]

2. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Add application server instances
   - Use load balancer (HAProxy/nginx)
   - Ensure database connection pooling handles increased connections

3. **Database Scaling**
   - Read replicas for report queries
   - Consider partitioning appointments table by date (if >1M rows)
   - Monitor VACUUM and ANALYZE schedules

### Code Optimizations

1. **Async/Await Patterns**
   ```python
   # Use asyncio.gather for parallel operations
   rooms, appointments, rules = await asyncio.gather(
       fetch_rooms(clinic_id),
       fetch_appointments(date_range),
       fetch_rules(clinic_id)
   )
   ```

2. **Bulk Operations**
   ```python
   # Batch conflict checks instead of per-room queries
   conflicts = await check_conflicts_batch(room_ids, time_slot)
   ```

3. **Cache Warming**
   ```python
   # Pre-load frequently accessed policies on startup
   await policy_cache.warm_cache(active_clinic_ids)
   ```
