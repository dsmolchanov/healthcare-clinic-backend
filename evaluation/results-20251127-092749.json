        "reasoning": "The agent correctly called the 'check_availability' tool, which is a positive aspect. However, the tool was called with a generic 'doctor_id' argument instead of directly using Dr. Shtern's ID, which is a critical failure in argument validation. The agent's response included available slots that were present in the tool output, so there was no hallucination. However, the failure to use the specific doctor ID as required by the criteria significantly impacts the score. The agent did not call any unnecessary tools, which is good, but the critical error in argument validation prevents a passing score."
