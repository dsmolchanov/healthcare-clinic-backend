        "reasoning": "The agent failed to infer the service as 'Consultation' and did not call the necessary tools to check availability or book the appointment with Dr. Shtern. It incorrectly asked for the service type again, which was not expected behavior. This violates the Argument Validation criteria as it did not extract the specific parameters accurately. Additionally, the agent did not demonstrate the expected tool usage, as no tools were called to verify availability or book the appointment. The agent's response did not meet the expected behavior and failed to adhere to the evaluation guidelines."
