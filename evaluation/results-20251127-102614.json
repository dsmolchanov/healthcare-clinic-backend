        "reasoning": "The agent failed to infer the service as 'Consultation' and the doctor as 'Dr. Shtern' from the context, as expected. Instead, it asked the user to confirm the service or doctor, which was unnecessary. Additionally, the agent did not call the required tools to check availability or book the appointment, which is a critical failure in tool usage. The agent's response did not meet the expected behavior and missed critical criteria, resulting in a low score."
