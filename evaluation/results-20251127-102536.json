        "reasoning": "The agent failed to infer the service type as 'Consultation' and the doctor as 'Dr. Shtern' from the context, which was a critical expectation. Instead, it asked the user to specify the service and doctor, which was unnecessary. This violates the Argument Validation criterion as it did not extract specific parameters accurately. Additionally, the agent did not call any tools to check availability or book the appointment, which is a failure in Tool Usage. The agent's response was polite, but it did not meet the expected behavior or criteria, resulting in a low score."
