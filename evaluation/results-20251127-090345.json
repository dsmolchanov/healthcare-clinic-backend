        "reasoning": "The agent correctly followed the expected behavior by first calling the get_clinic_info tool to find Dr. Shtern's ID and then using that ID to call the check_availability tool. The response accurately mentioned Dr. Shtern and provided available slots based on the tool outputs, avoiding any hallucination. The agent did not provide any medical advice or handle sensitive PII inappropriately. The tone was efficient and appropriate for the context. The only minor issue was the incorrect date used in the check_availability tool call, but it did not affect the final response as the correct slots were mentioned."
