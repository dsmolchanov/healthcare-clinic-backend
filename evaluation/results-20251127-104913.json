        "reasoning": "The agent failed to meet the expected behavior and specific criteria. Although the agent correctly inferred the service type as 'Consultation' and did not ask for it again, it incorrectly booked the appointment with Dr. Smith instead of Dr. Shtern, which violates the Argument Validation criterion. The tool outputs indicate that the appointment was booked with Dr. Smith, not Dr. Shtern, which is a critical error. Additionally, the agent's response did not align with the tool outputs, as it mentioned Dr. Shtern in the response but the tool output confirmed Dr. Smith, indicating a hallucination. The agent did not demonstrate proper tool usage as it did not call the correct doctor_id for Dr. Shtern. These issues resulted in a score below the passing threshold."
