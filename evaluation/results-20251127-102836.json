        "reasoning": "The agent failed to infer the service as 'Consultation' and the doctor as 'Dr. Shtern' from the context, which led to an unnecessary question about the service type. This violates the expected behavior and argument validation criteria. Additionally, the agent did not call the necessary tools to check availability or book the appointment, which is a critical failure in tool usage. The agent's response did not meet the expected behavior, resulting in a low score."
