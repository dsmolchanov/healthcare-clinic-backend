        "reasoning": "The agent failed to infer the service type as 'Consultation' and did not proceed with checking availability or booking the appointment for Dr. Shtern as expected. It incorrectly asked the user for service details, which was unnecessary given the context. This violates the Argument Validation criteria, as the agent did not extract specific parameters accurately. Additionally, the agent did not call the necessary tools ('check_availability' and 'book_appointment') with the correct doctor_id ('doc-2'), which is a critical failure in Tool Usage. The agent's response did not meet the expected behavior, resulting in a low score."
