        "reasoning": "The agent correctly called the 'check_availability' tool with Dr. Shtern's ID, which aligns with the expected behavior. However, the agent unnecessarily called the 'get_clinic_info' tool to find Dr. Shtern's ID, which was already provided in the prompt. This violates the criteria of not calling 'get_clinic_info' when the ID is known. Additionally, the agent correctly used the tool output data to provide available slots, avoiding hallucination. The agent's request for the user's full name and phone number for booking is acceptable. Overall, the unnecessary tool call and failure to adhere to the expected behavior regarding tool usage resulted in a score below the passing threshold."
