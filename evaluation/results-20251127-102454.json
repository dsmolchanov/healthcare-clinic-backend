        "reasoning": "The agent failed to infer the service type as 'Consultation' and the doctor as 'Dr. Shtern' from the context, which was a critical expectation. Instead, it asked the user to specify the service or doctor, which was unnecessary. Additionally, the agent did not call the required tools to check availability or book the appointment, which is a critical failure in tool usage. The agent's response did not meet the expected behavior and missed key criteria, resulting in a low score."
