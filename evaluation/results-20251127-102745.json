        "reasoning": "The agent failed to infer the service as 'Consultation' and did not proceed to check availability or book the appointment with Dr. Shtern as expected. Instead, it asked the user to specify the service and date, which was unnecessary given the context. This violates the Argument Validation criterion as the agent did not extract specific parameters accurately. Additionally, the agent did not call the required tools ('check_availability' and 'book_appointment'), which is a critical failure in Tool Usage. The response was polite, but the lack of correct tool usage and inference led to a low score."
